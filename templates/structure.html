    <p class="lead">I will be synthesizing a lot of matter from:</p>
    <ul class="lead">Islamic thought</ul>
    <ul class="lead">Neuroscience</ul>
    <ul class="lead">Heinz Kohut</ul>
    <p class="lead">This is an attempt to have a comprehensive understanding of human nature which would enable us to choose the correct educational, social, and political system, for human beings. The reason I am using each of them is that they fit with each other logically alongside my observations about human nature. That being said, let's proceed.</p>
    <p class="lead">To begin to understand a computer, we must first penetrate the two very basic things: Hardware and basic software. By basic software, I mean the kernel which is without any extra utilities. It is necessary for the operation. The brain and the hormonal structure of a person can be called hardware. The development of the brain is one of the prerequisites of a healthy life of a person. There are several stages of development of the brain in children. One of the most important ranges of years is between ages 0-3. At this age, the brain has almost twice as many synapses as an adult brain. This helps the baby in learning at this early stage. To understand what happens during this stage better, you should check out this article:</p>
    <a class="lead" href="http://www.urbanchildinstitute.org/why-0-3/baby-and-brain">Baby’s Brain Begins Now: Conception to Age 3</a>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">The second stage is between ages 3-5. This is the stage of development of motor skills. Do not underestimate them. Their development leads to the betterment of cognition later in life. To understand this better you must look into this:</p>
    <a class="lead" href="https://www.enfagrow.com.sg/development/child-3-till-6/milestones/brain-development-3-5-years">Your Child’s Brain Development: 3 to 5 Years</a>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">The third stage is between ages 5-7 and then comes another one from 7-10. To have a better insight into this please read the following:</p>
    <a class="lead" href="https://ndafp.org/image/cache/18s.pdf">Early Childhood Brain Development</a>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">The reason I am not going into the details of biology is that I have posted the links and I do not wish to re-invent the wheel. There are further stages as well but the above-mentioned are important. Up to the age of 10, the growth of brain cells is quite important as the physical growth of the brain means more synapses and, consequently, more learning and intelligence. The development of brain cells, or any cells for that matter, requires growth hormone. For this very reason, good care of nutrition is to be taken during this time. However, what most people forget is, for nutrition to work as it is supposed to the environment has to be stable. If there is violence or any other factors that trigger stress in the kid's brain the hormone called Cortisol will be released. This would lead to inhibition of the growth hormone and, hence, the inhibition of brain growth.</p>
    <p class="lead">Violence is not the only thing that inhibits growth hormones. The contemporary schooling system is one of the biggest sources of stress among children. It had been well-documented and researched upon. The stress of academic development and of the place that revolves around operant conditioning geared towards punishments is one of the universal stressors among children. A research will clarify this point:</p>
    <a class="lead" href="http://website60s.com/upload/files/children-s-cortisol-response-to-the-transition-from-pres_2019_psychoneuroend.pdf">Children’s cortisol response to the transition from preschool to formal schooling: A review</a>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">It is not just the violence that can impact children negatively, but also any situation that stimulates fear. For example, yelling and consistent stern faces can also impact them since a human child can easily distinguish between expressions. It is even simpler if you are a Muslim. There is a hadees about the correct age of teaching Salah.</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
      <p class="mb-0">"Teach a child to pray, beginning at the age of 7, and punish him for refusing it from the age of 10"</p>
      <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">at-Tirmizi  No. 407 </cite></footer>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">In the hierarchy of Islamic thought, Salah is the highest possible good and an obligation. If Islam is teaching us that the age of 7 is the age of teaching routine through the positive reinforcement limited to reward then why do we Muslims choose to ignore such teachings? If punishment to reinforce Salah is allowed only after the age of 10 then why exactly do we punish our children for other trivial things, like academic progress, before that? Is it not parents going against the rights of children set by Islam? Holy Prophet PBUH, on the other hand, never used corporal punishments against children. I am ashamed that we had to use science to convince Muslims so that they would not retard their children.</p>
    <p class="lead">Anyways, let's move on to the next more complex aspect of the personality. We will return to biology and might refer to the aspects we already talked about above. The very basic personality of a human being is Soul or ‘Rooh’. It is a complete personality that a human being is born with. However, as life moves on another personality starts developing in parallel. I call this a fake personality which is a source of most evil and pain in the world.</p>

    <p class="lead">In Islamic thought, the Soul, or Rooh, is something divine that is attached to the human body. It is only possessed by humans, and is different from intellect or Aql. The philosophical discussion about the true nature of Rooh and soul had been going on. Regarding our limited knowledge on the subject, Mufti Muhammad Shafi Usmani beautifully summarizes our approach towards the understanding of Rooh in Maarif Ul Quran under the explanation of ayat (17:85) by synthesizing many previous views on the subject:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
      <p class="mb-0">"And they ask you about the Spirit. Say, "The Spirit is of the Command of my Lord; and in no way have you been brought of knowledge except a little."</p>

    <p class="lead">Explanation:</p>

    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">Moving a bit further in another couple of ayaat Quran talks about the creation of Adam. Within those ayaat there was one ayat in which Quran talked about the fact that the Rooh or soul was breathed in Adam:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
      <p class="mb-0">(28. And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "I am going to create a man (Adam) from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. '') (29. "So, when I have fashioned him completely and breathed into him (Adam) of My spirit (the soul which I created for him,) then fall down, prostrating yourselves before him.'') (30. So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together.) (31. Except Iblis (Shaytan) - he refused to be among the prostrate.) (32. (Allah) said: "O Iblis! What is your reason for not being among the prostrate'' (33. Iblis ﴾said: "I am not one to prostrate myself to a human, whom You created from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud.'')"</p>

    </blockquote>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">In the explanation of Ayat 15:29, Mufti Muhammad Shafi Usmani again synthesizes all the past views Muslim scholars have held:</p>
    <a class="lead" href="https://quran.com/15:29/tafsirs/168">Maarif Ul Quran</a>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">To summarize Rooh or Soul, we must understand that there are several levels of existence. These are realities that are hidden from the human eye for the purpose of the test. These realities exist in parallel to us like another dimension. Out of all of them Rooh or Soul is from the world(or dimension) or Amr (Or command) (Alam e Amr). In this reality, material cause and effect or changes do not occur like in our reality which is the world(or dimension) of creation (Alam e Khalq).</p>
    <p class="lead">As a child grows up it develops a personality parallel to this one. This personality develops due to either of two reasons:</p>
    <ul class="lead">Unbeliever parents</ul>
    <ul class="lead">Believing parents but not acting accordingly</ul>
    <p class="lead">The proof of which can be found in this Hadees:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
      <p class="mb-0">"Abu Huraira reported: The Prophet, peace, and blessings be upon him, said, “No child is born but that he is upon natural instinct (Fitrah). His parents make him a Jew, or a Christian, or Magian. As an animal delivers a child with limbs intact, do you detect any flaw?” Then, Abu Huraira recited the verse, “The nature of Allah upon which he has set people,” (30:30)."</p>

      <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">Al Bukhari 1292, Al Muslim 2658</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">A good explanation of the ayat mentioned in the Hadees can again be found in Maarif ul Quran by Mufti Muhammad Shafi Usmani:</p>
    <a class="lead" href="https://quran.com/30:30/tafsirs/168">Maarif Ul Quran</a>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">In this explanation, you will find all the arguments regarding Fitrah. In conclusion, Fitrah is the pure instinct that Allah Swt created in human beings. The ability to discern the truth of Islam is with all. From this, we can conclude that this instinct can be suppressed and rendered ineffective or weak if the environment of the child is as such. To understand this new personality that develops in parallel to the personality of Rooh or Soul which is a part of Fitrah, there is no better work done than the ones done by psychoanalysts. To understand that I will be taking the help of three psychoanalysts I mentioned at the start of the article.</p>

  <div class="mx-auto container" style="max-width: 900px;">
    <p class="lead">The reason I am mentioning this name is that it was coined by the psychologist Heinz Kohut. In this book, he described the structure of what he called Self. If you were following from the start you will know that in our philosophy this is not the original self. It is a parallel self that was developed by our minds to cope with environmental problems instead of the Cohesive Self that should have been developed. However, Kohut does not have a relationship with Islamic thought so he chooses to restore this particular self if the expressions of it go out of proportion with what society deems right. In other words, he aims to restore that Cohesive Self that was underdeveloped. I mean that is precisely the role of psychology and psychiatry to pull individuals back into capitalist normalcy. We cannot deny his research explains a lot of human behavior and, hence, we will take understanding from his research. He starts by telling us that children have a natural narcissism. They develop a protective and inflated self-image when the mother inevitably fails to respond adequately to that natural narcissism. I would say that this natural narcissism is a part of the human biological self which is all about self-preservation. To learn more about Kohut’s structure of Self read this:</p>
    <a class="lead" href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/famous-psychologists/heinz-kohut.html">Contribution to Psychology</a>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">As per the psychology of Heinz Kohut, this Grandiose Self is a bundle of structures made to protect the natural narcissism. Our aim, however, is to remove this parallel self in the easiest possible way and restore an individual back to the Divine Self or Rooh/Soul. This should be the core aim of our psychology and Educational system. Unfortunately, we have adopted the system of others and have led our children astray. The system we have adopted of both, upbringing and schooling system, is the basis of quite strong Grandiose Self. This would mean a child would be further away from its true self and Allah SWT. Today we develop adults who are mostly devoid of reasoning and morality. Why should we then expect the world to change?</p>

  <div class="mx-auto container" style="max-width: 900px;">
    <p class="lead">The basis of our philosophy is to remove the Grandiose Self so the Rooh or Soul can manifest as the true Self. So the highest point of evolution of Self or Existence is the person whose Rooh or Soul has manifested itself and taken over the mind. The most fundamental trigger point of change is the acceptance of the Islamic Faith. Without it, the changes one goes through in life will just be the replacement of one compensatory structure with another. As per Islamic thought, we can categorize people according to which of the either two selves, the Grandiose Self or the Rooh, had taken over a person’s mind. We can categorize people into three types according to the conqueror Self:</p>
    <ul class="lead">Nafs Ul Ammara</ul>
    <ul class="lead">Nafs Ul Lawwama</ul>
    <ul class="lead">Nafs Ul Mutma'inna</ul>
    <h3 class="fw-bold">Nafs Ul Ammara:</h3>
    <p class="lead">If the Self of appetite and self-preservation, or the Grandiose Self, takes over the mind then a person is said to have Nafs ul Ammara. It instigates a self-worshipping thought process and, hence, commands us to do what we call sin. Sin is every action that transgresses the limits of what was revealed by Allah SWT: the Shariah. Some actions of Grandiose Self might not transgress the limits but they will eventually, given that its highest good is itself. Quran talks about this:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
      <p class="mb-0">“Indeed the nafs that overwhelmingly commands a person to do sin.”</p>
      <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">(12:53)</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">When the Grandiose Self is the primary Self of a person the person’s sole purpose to live is for pleasure and self-preservation. In other words, you can say that the highest good for that person is their own self. It is one of a kind of Shirk e Khafi when you worship yourself instead of Allah SWT. The three stages mentioned above are also within the grasp of human wisdom. Soren Kierkegaard calls this stage aesthetic existence.</p>
    <p class="lead">Islam is against monasticism. It recognizes that appetites are a part of regular human bodily function. A healthy fulfillment of appetite is necessary. However, Islam also recognizes that if it is left unrestrained then it will take over one’s mind. Hence a restraint of appetite and selfishness are two basic essences that govern many rulings in Shariah. Note that Grandiose Self is not Nafs ul Ammara. But instead Nafs ul Ammara is the state where Grandiose Self had taken over the mind.</p>
    <h3 class="fw-bold">Nafs Ul Lawwama:</h3>
    <p class="lead">This is the stage of conflict. It's a conflict of power over the mind between the Grandiose Self and Rooh or Soul. This stage is the stage where conscience is most active. When temporarily the Grandiose Self takes over the person sins. When the Rooh or Soul when gains control the guilt takes over. Nafs ul Lawwama literally means accusatory-self. Quran talks about this state of Self:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
      <p class="mb-0">“And I swear by the reproaching soul [to the certainty of resurrection].”</p>
      <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">(75:2)</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">Most of the humanity is at this level. Kierkegaard’s ethical stage of existence can be compared with this. This is the first time a person experiences the Soul in adulthood and is in a conflict of what he ought to do. He is growing with the help of Rooh while being restrained by Grandiose Self. This is the first time morals become very important to a person and it initiates the search for the highest good.</p>
    <h3 class="fw-bold">Nafs Ul Mutma'inna:</h3>
    <p class="lead">This literally means the fulfilled, reassured, or content Self. The Quran mentions this state:</p>
    <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
      <p class="mb-0">“To the righteous it will be said “oh reassured soul, return to your Lord well pleased, and pleasing to Him””</p>
      <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
      <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite title="Source Title">(89:27-28)</cite></footer>
    </blockquote>
    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">This is the stage where Rooh completely takes over the mind and the Grandiose Self falls apart. It is achieved after succeeding in several painful trials given to us by Allah SWT. The contentment is achieved because Rooh or the true Self is no longer suppressed and it connects back to where it came from: Allah SWT. This is a mercy from Him as we would not be able to achieve contentment and inner peace without it. </p>
    <p class="lead">Kierkegaard calls this stage the religious stage which is achieved after the person takes a ‘leap of faith'. This leap is required because all your perceptions about reality are eliminated due to the elimination of the Grandiose Self. When the Grandiose Self is dying out it feels the threat of survival since, unlike Rooh or Soul, it is not eternal. A person cannot place this threat of survival in any object. Existential philosophers call this feeling ‘Existential dread’ or ‘Existential Angst’. At this stage, faith matters more than anything else. If you do not believe in God, then you do not have a connection to Rooh or Soul. Hence, you will never pass on from this stage. You will desperately try to build new structures for building your new perception of reality but they will always be weak given that you now have experienced the reality and felt Existential Angst.</p>

    <p class="lead">At the start, we talked about the stages of brain development up till the age of 10. After this age prefrontal cortex starts developing. Until the age of 25, the ‘thinking side’ of the brain develops. If you want to understand more about this please follow this link:</p>

    <div class="d-grid gap-3"><div class="p-2"></div></div>
    <p class="lead">If we connect this with the hadees about Salah it fits quite well considering this is the age of teaching decision making and setting up a hierarchy of importance in the child’s mind. Since, initially, the prefrontal cortex is only developing the child’s core decision-making process is still driven by the amygdala which is instinct, aggression, and impulse. Hence, this is where the introduction of punishment would actually work without damaging the more vulnerable stages of development. This is where the child would actually learn to understand right and wrong due to the parallel development of the prefrontal cortex. Five years of such training would lead to a person with a self-reliant decision-making process and that is when, at the age of 15, a person becomes an adult according to Islamic Fiqh. The Salah becomes obligatory and the hierarchy of thought due to the development of higher cognition is established.</p>
    <p class="lead">This is also the age where there is also a spurt in sexual impulses and ability. This is when most teens arrive at puberty. The restrictions are to be placed at this age while also giving the freedom of mind to explore. To further understand this follow this link:</p>

    <p class="lead">This philosophy aims to create systems that lead to the development of a society of people who can harmonize the world. All people have different capabilities through which they can help the world. However, all of them have Rooh that needs to manifest itself to connect with Allah SWT and fulfill the purpose of this life while bringing contentment in the people. The first step towards this is to create an education system that takes into account all the knowledge Islam and Science had given us and produce a working educational institutions that produce such kids. A deeper study of Sciences and the Islamic knowledge will reveal a concrete system. </p>
